YBTC aims to generate monthly income while providing exposure to the price returns of one or more US-listed ETFs holding Bitcoin futures contracts (Bitcoin ETFs), subject to a cap on potential gains. The fund utilizes a synthetic covered call strategy via standardized exchange-traded and FLEX options, which consists of i) synthetic long exposure, ii) covered call writing, and iii) US Treasurys and cash.

RISR aims to benefit from rising interest rates by seeking a duration target of approximately negative 10 years.

The Underlying Index is reconstituted annually with quarterly rebalance. The fund's sibling fund, SDOG, applies the same strategy to the S&P 500.","The investment seeks investment results that replicate as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the performance of the S-Network® International Sector Dividend Dogs Index.

As with all levered and inverse funds, GUSH should not be expected to deliver 2 times the performance of its index for periods longer than one day. Compounding and path-dependency can cause significant deviations over longer time frames, so it's best used for single-day tactical plays. It's worth noting that GUSH's index is equal weighted, market-cap weighting would require extreme concentration in a handful of major firms. As a result, GUSH exhibits a serious small-cap tilt and the elevated market risk that comes with it. GUSH's leverage factor only amplifies the potential for volatility. Trading costs should be taken into consideration.

FTIF provides exposure to US equities within the energy, real estate, industrials, and materials sectors. These sectors tend to outperform in inflationary environments. The selection process begins with components of the Bloomberg US 3000 Index. The top 50 companies based on market capitalization from each of the four sectors are considered. A screen for highly levered companies removes the top 10% from the selection process. The remaining stocks are screened further using two inflationary metrics: high beta to 2-year inflation breakeven and high beta to Bloomberg Commodity Index. Within each sector, the top 50% based on their combined inflationary metric score are evaluated further. The top 50 companies with the highest free-cash-flow yield based on trailing 12-months are selected for the index, up to a cap of 20 stocks from a single sector. Stocks are equally weighted within the index. An index reconstitution and rebalance is conducted semi-annually, in January and July.","The investment seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield, before fees and expenses, of an equity index called the Bloomberg Inflation Sensitive Equity Index (the “Index”).

The underlying index is comprised of the top U.S. listed equity positions reported on Form 13F by a select group of entities characterized as hedge funds."
