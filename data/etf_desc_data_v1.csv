The final step in the process screens out companies that havent exhibited these ESG characteristics for three consecutive years.

The fund is non-diversified.","RISR seeks to provide income and protect against rising interest rates through exposure to interest-only MBS and US Treasury bonds. The fund is actively managed.

RISR aims to benefit from rising interest rates by seeking a duration target of approximately negative 10 years. A negative duration is where prices increase as interest rates rise, and the adviser believes that the fund holdings value is expected to increase with such a duration target. RISR primarily invests in interest-only MBS (MBS IOs), typically with negative duration, and US Treasury bonds, which have positive duration. The portfolio is structured such that a potential decline in MBS IO valuations may be partially offset by gains in the US Treasury positions. As such, the fund will likely be rebalanced by selling the US Treasury positions and increasing MBS IO holdings to bring its overall duration back to its duration target. The adviser determines the overall asset allocation between MBS IOs and US Treasurys based on its top-down and security-specific analysis.

LQDI,iShares Inflation Hedged Corporate Bond ETF,"The fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in component securities and instruments in the fund’s underlying index.","LQDI tracks an index that holds the iShares iBoxx USD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD), which targets investment-grade corporate bond, while using swaps to hedge inflation risk.

LQDI tracks an index that combines a long position in iShares iBoxx USD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) with an overlay of inflation swaps. By entering these swaps, the fund agrees to give up a portion of the fixed payments it receives from LQDs bond portfolio in exchange for floating payments tied to the inflation rate. Because inflation is already priced into the market for corporate bonds, the fund effectively hedges inflation expectations, rather than the inflation rate itself. Therefore, even if inflation rises, LQDI will underperform if the rise is less than expected. The fund will outperform (before costs) when inflation exceeds expectations.

Over longer periods, returns can vary significantly from 2x exposure to its underlying index. Holding it for a period longer than that will introduce the effects of compounding, even if this is less pronounced in a non-leveraged product.

AAPB is a short-term tactical tool that aims to deliver 2x the price return, less fees and expenses, for a single day of Apple stock. Purchasers holding shares for longer than a day need to monitor and frequently rebalance their position to attempt to achieve the 2x multiple.

Aside from the leverage, the shares take on added volatility due to lack of diversification. Purchasers should conduct their own stock research prior to initiating a position and trade with conviction. Due to the complexities of the product, shares tend to perform as anticipated only when underlying shares are trending and holders are on the positive corresponding side of that trade. However, the shares provide the advantage of capping the maximum loss to the full amount invested.

BWET is the first oil tanker shipping ETF. Oil tanker shipping is an instrumental part of the global commodity market and is historically uncorrelated with other major asset classes.

MRNY,YieldMax MRNA Option Income Strategy ETF,"The fund advisor will employ the fund's investment strategy as the fund relates to MRNA regardless of whether there are periods of adverse market, economic, or other conditions and will take temporary defensive positions during such periods.

For each commodity, the index selects the contract with the greatest backwardation in an attempt to mitigate roll costs. The 14 contracts are equally weighted, with monthly reconstitution and rebalancing. The fund is organized as an open-ended ETF, so does not issue a K-1 at tax time.

Selected based on high dividend yield and low volatility.

ALTY takes a broad, multi-asset approach in its quest for income.

The fund seeks to emulate the returns of an index that takes long and short positions in currency, commodity, and Treasury futures.

WTMF seeks positive, uncorrelated returns using long and short positions in commodity, currency, and Treasury futures. The ETF does not explicitly track an index, but nonetheless, aims to provide the returns of a WisdomTree benchmark index. The index selects from 24 diversified, near-month futures contracts. At each monthly rebalance, the four most volatile contracts are screened out while the rest are assigned equal weight. Long and short positions are determined by the contracts' 3-, 6-, and 12-month momentum signals. If there is a conflict between the three signals, the majority will determine the direction and the position will be reduced, one-third will be replaced with short-term Treasurys. The index will not take short positions in energy futures. Overall, the strategy favors clear momentum trends without excessive volatility.
