SGDM offers exposure to equity in gold mining firms. The index-based fund holds stocks classified as gold miners in Americas and Asia/Pacific according to the RBICS industry system.

GVAL offers an unusual take on the global equity market as it attempts to identify and capture value opportunities on a country-by-country basis. Stocks selected must be domiciled, trade, or have exposure to a market that is undervalued as determined by various valuation metrics including the CAPE Shiller P/E ratio. During its annual reconstitution, Cambria selects positions by applying a quantitative screen (potentially including P/E, P/B, P/CF, P/S and dividend yield) to entire equity markets and includes caps to avoid concentration in any one country, sector or industry.

Companies in the top 70% within each sector are selected. Companies are further screened based on any continued and significant non-compliance to Candriams ESG criteria to exclude from the final index. The index is market-cap weighted with 10% cap placed on each security. IQSI is reconstituted and rebalanced quarterly. Prior to Aug. 28, 2024, the fund name was branded under IndexIQ.","The investment seeks investment results that track (before fees and expenses) the price and yield performance of its underlying index, the NYLI Candriam International Equity Index.

AGIH follows an index that combines a long position in iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) with an overlay of inflation swaps. The fund includes a fixed number of AGGs shares and a series of up to 10 inflation swap contracts with different maturities, intended to hedge the portfolios inflation risk at key points on the yield curve. By entering these swaps, the fund agrees to give up a portion of the fixed payments it receives from AGGs bond portfolio in exchange for floating payments tied to the inflation rate. Since inflation is already priced into the market for bonds, the fund effectively hedges inflation expectations rather than the inflation rate itself. Thus, even if inflation rises, AGIH will underperform AGG if the rise is less than expected, and will outperform (before costs) when inflation exceeds expectations. Swaps are rebalanced daily and restructured monthly. Due to the potential use of futures and options, the fund is registered as a commodity pool.","The investment seeks to track the investment results of the BlackRock Inflation Hedged U.S. Aggregate Bond Index designed to minimize the inflation risk of a portfolio composed of U.S. dollar-denominated, investment-grade bonds.

Eligible securities should also meet the market-cap and liquidity screens. The index then selects the top 100 stocks with the highest dividend yield, with no more than 20 stocks from a single country.

SWAN aims to provide muted equity exposure while mitigating downside risk. The fund gets its equity exposure via long-dated options (LEAPS) on SPY, the mega-ETF tracking the S&P 500. The options specifically target 70% participation in either direction (up or down) over the market cycle. They roll in June and December. The Treasury portion provides additional downside protection, assuming that safe-haven Treasurys will rise if equity markets tank. The Treasurys a mix of maturities aiming to reflect 10-years on aggregate provide their own risk and return (duration and yield). SWANs asset ratio is fixed at 90% Treasurys and 10% options at each semi-annual index reset. However, the indexs equity notional exposure aligns with the total index market cap, so each dollar invested aims for dollars worth of notional equity exposure (at 70% participation) plus 90 cents of 10-year Treasurys.","The investment seeks results that generally correspond (before fees and expenses) to the price and yield of the S-Network BlackSwan Core Index (the ""index"").

MOOD considers the difference in sentiment between institutional and retail investors, or relative sentiment, to manage a multi-asset portfolio of equities, bonds, and gold.

To determine allocation to equity ETFs, the adviser takes the average of the four indicators. The remainder of the portfolio is allocated to fixed income ETFs including TIPS, and in some instances, gold ETPs.

HIPS,GraniteShares HIPS US High Income ETF,"The fund employs a ""passive management""-or indexing-investment approach designed to track the performance of the index. The rules-based index measures the performance of up to 60 high income U.S.-listed securities that typically have ""pass-through"" structures that require them to distribute substantially all of their earnings to shareholders as cash distributions. This ""high income, pass-through"" strategy is known as HIPS.","HIPS tracks an equal-weighted index of US-listed assets that produce high income and pass through that income without being taxed at the constituent level. The portfolio includes REITs, MLPs, BDCs, and closed-end funds.

HIPS offers a twist on the popular multi-asset income space: a focus on pass-through securities (those that pass on most of their income to their owners). The owners pay taxes on that income, while the entities themselves dont, thereby eliminating the double taxation associated with stock dividends. The portfolio allocates equally to four alternative income segments: closed-end funds (CEFs), business development companies (BDCs), real estate investment trusts (REITs), and energy master limited partnerships (MLPs). The top 10 securities with the highest dividend yield and lowest volatility in each segment are selected and weighted equally. It should be noted that while income from REITs, MLPs and BDCs can be high, these are typically taxed at ordinary-income rates instead of the beneficial qualified dividends rate. As such, investors in taxable accounts should consider their after-tax yield. Before March 16, 2023, the fund tracked the TFMS HIPS Index.","The investment seeks to track the performance, before fees and expenses, of the EQM High Income Pass-Through Securities Index.

GOAU provides an alternate take on the mining space by using fundamental analysis and complex tiered weighting. Unlike some competitors, the fund includes royalty and streaming companies, which provide capital to mining start-ups in exchange for a stake in the eventual production. GOAU starts by screening out mining firms that are financed primarily with debt. Miners in the top 10% by revenue per employee are deemed as priority firms. The index scores priority firms by revenue/employees, operating cash flow/employees, and gross margin, and other firms by operating cash flow/enterprise value.
