CRED,Columbia ETF Trust I - Columbia Research Enhanced Real Estate ETF,"This exchange-traded fund provides exposure to U.S. real estate investment trusts (REITs) by seeking to track the performance of a rules-based, strategic beta index before fees and expenses. Investing at least 80% of its net assets in the index's component securities, the fund utilizes a distinct methodology that begins with a broad universe of publicly listed U.S. REITs. This approach employs a multi-factor quantitative model screening for quality, value, and catalyst attributes, excluding the lowest-ranked companies before applying a liquidity filter. A key differentiator is the incorporation of a proprietary geographic exposure score, assessing the growth potential and relevant trends in the markets where REITs hold assets. The resulting portfolio, typically comprising 70-90 REITs and reconstituted annually, weights holdings based on a combination of market capitalization, the geographic score, and a forward dividend yield multiplier, reflecting an enhanced approach to REIT investing.

IXC,iShares Global Energy ETF,"This exchange-traded fund provides exposure to the global energy sector by tracking a market-capitalization-weighted index of international energy companies. While aiming to reflect the broad sector, its underlying index applies specific capping rules, limiting individual securities to 22.5% and the aggregate weight of issuers exceeding 4.5% to 45%, with quarterly rebalancing. The fund primarily invests at least 80% of its assets in the index's component securities or economically similar investments, potentially allocating up to 20% to derivatives, cash, or equivalents. Due to its market-cap weighting (even with caps) and the nature of the global energy industry, the portfolio exhibits a large-cap bias and is considered non-diversified, often resulting in significant concentration in a few dominant companies, particularly US-based giants.","The fund generally invests at least 80% of its assets in the component securities of its underlying index and in investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical to the component securities of its underlying index and may invest up to 20% of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents.

IXC fits the bill if youre looking for neutral exposure to the global energy sector.

The other side is that in a strengthening euro environment, the fund, hit by poor local returns and no FX gain, would lag an unhedged fund by an even greater amount.

Selecting the portfolio involves screening a broad market index for those that have a history of raising their dividends, while exhibiting characteristics to continue to do so. Each week, RDVI attempts to bridge the difference between the dividend income of its equity portfolio and its target distribution by selling at-the-money, naked call options on the S&P 500 Index or related ETFs. The income from dividends and option premiums are expected to be distributed monthly. Investors should note that naked call writing, or selling call options without owning the underlying asset, is a high-risk options strategy. The fund is actively managed however, there is no guarantee the fund will deliver the target income.",,"The investment seeks to provide investors with current income with a secondary objective of providing capital appreciation.

SNPV follows an index designed to provide exposure to large-cap value companies in the US that display positive environmental, social, and corporate governance attributes.

Each security undergoes various ESG screens to exclude those that do not have an ESG score or fall below the accepted 25%, and/or participate in business activities involving tobacco products, controversial weapons, thermal coal, oil sands, and assault weapons. The remaining securities are then selected for inclusion using their determined ESG scores, targeting 75% of the market-cap of each industry within the parent index. Each security is then market cap-weighted. The index is rebalanced annually and reweights quarterly.

Stocks with higher growth scores are selected until they represent approximately 50% of the parent index.

While concentrating exposure in biotechnology and medical research, it may also include significant pharmaceutical holdings.

SQY,YieldMax SQ Option Income Strategy ETF,"This actively managed fund aims to generate monthly income while providing capped exposure to the price movements of Block, Inc.

It achieves this by creating synthetic long exposure to SQ using various options (both standardized exchange-traded and FLEX) and simultaneously writing short-term, out-of-the-money call options (typically 5-15% above the current price) to generate income; this inherently limits potential gains if the underlying stock appreciates significantly. The strategy is collateralized primarily by cash and short-term US Treasury securities. Notably, the fund does not invest directly in SQ shares, meaning investors receive no dividends from the underlying stock. It maintains its non-diversified investment approach consistently, regardless of adverse market or economic conditions, without taking temporary defensive positions.","The fund will seek to employ its investment strategy as it relates to SQ regardless of whether there are periods adverse market, economic, or other conditions and will not seek to take temporary defensive positions during such periods.

The actively managed fund uses both standardized exchange-traded and FLEX options.

SQY aims to generate monthly income while providing exposure to the price returns of the stock, Block, Inc. (SQ), subject to a cap on potential investment gains. The fund utilizes a synthetic covered call strategy via standardized exchange-traded and FLEX options, which consists of three elements: i) synthetic long exposure, ii) covered call writing, and iii) US Treasurys. The synthetic long exposure seeks to replicate the price movements of SQ by purchasing and selling at-the-money call and put options that generally have six-month to one-year terms. To generate income, the fund writes call options with an expiration of one month or less and a strike price 5%-15% above SQs current share price. This limits the funds participation in potential gains if SQ shares increase in value. Lastly, the fund holds cash and short-term Treasury securities as collateral. Note: the fund does not invest directly in shares of Block. Thus, investors are not entitled to any SQ dividends.","The fund will employ its investment strategy as it relates to SQ regardless of whether there are periods of adverse market, economic, or other conditions and will not take temporary defensive positions during such periods.

URAX,Defiance Daily Target 2X Long Uranium ETF,"This actively managed, non-diversified exchange-traded fund aims to deliver two times (200%) the daily percentage change of the Global X Uranium ETF (URA), before accounting for fees and expenses. It utilizes swap agreements based on the URA, thereby providing leveraged exposure to companies engaged in uranium mining, production, and related nuclear component activities tracked by the underlying ETF. The fund rebalances its portfolio daily to maintain the target 200% leverage. Conceived as a high-risk, short-term tactical instrument, its returns over periods exceeding a single day can significantly diverge from the 2x objective due to the effects of daily compounding.

The security was delisted. The last day of trading on an exchange is April 16, 2025. URAX uses swap agreements to make bullish bets on (URA) Global X Uranium ETFs share price. URA tracks a market cap-weighted index that focuses on pure-play companies engaged in the production and mining of nuclear components. The fund maintains a daily leveraged exposure equivalent to 200% of the funds net assets through daily rebalancing. As a geared product, the fund is intended as a short-term tactical tool, rather than as a long-term investment vehicle. As a result, returns may deviate from the expected 2x if held for longer than a single day due to compounding. This strategy is high-risk and does not include a defensive position as part of its overall process. Additionally, the fund could potentially lose money over time, even if URA's performance strengthens.

AGIH,iShares Inflation Hedged U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF,"This ETF provides exposure to U.S. dollar-denominated, investment-grade bonds while employing a strategy designed to minimize inflation risk.

The investment universe is comprised of the top 1,000 U.S. stocks by market capitalization, including REITs, drawn from the Dow Jones U.S. Index, with individual stocks typically equally weighted within their respective sectors.

While BTAL uses swaps at times, it typically takes direct short positions in stocks rather than relying solely on derivatives for short exposure. Therefore, the fund reports short interest costs in its expense ratio, something that purely swaps-based long-short funds don`t have to do, although short interest expense hits the bottom line in either case.

Within each chosen sector, ten stocks selected for their individual interest rate sensitivity are included and equally weighted, composing a 50-stock portfolio primarily drawn from the largest 500 U.S. firms, though mid-caps may be included if needed.

Its defining characteristic is the equal-weighting methodology applied to its holdings, which contrasts sharply with market-cap weighted indexes by significantly reducing the concentration in the largest technology firms. Consequently, this approach results in a distinct portfolio composition, often overweighting areas like semiconductors while underweighting software and IT services relative to broader tech benchmarks, and inherently excludes major technology companies not listed on the Nasdaq.

The fund uses a fixed weighting scheme, rebalanced annually, that allocates 90% to TD3C VLCC (Very Large Crude Carrier) contracts and 10% to TD20 Suezmax contracts. As futures are always an imperfect proxy for spot prices and the freight futures market is often in contango, long-term holdings are subject to position decay. BWET is structured as a commodities pool so investors can expect a K-1 at tax time and long-term holders will be taxed on any gains even without selling shares. The fund is only intended to be used as a diversification opportunity and is not a complete investment program.",Freight Futures reflect market expectations for the future cost of transporting crude oil. Each Reference index is published each United Kingdom business day by the London-based Baltic Exchange Ltd. and measures the charter rate for shipping crude oil in a specific size category of cargo ship and for a specific route.,"The investment seeks to provide investors with exposure to the daily change in the price of crude oil tanker freight futures before expenses and liabilities of the fund, by tracking the performance of a portfolio mainly consisting of the nearest calendar quarter of futures contracts on specified indexes that measure prices for shipping crude oil.

IEDI,iShares Evolved U.S. Discretionary Spending ETF,"This actively managed, non-diversified fund provides exposure to U.S. companies across large, mid, and small capitalizations involved in discretionary spending, investing at least 80% of its assets in their common stock.

UYM,ProShares Ultra Basic Materials,"This non-diversified fund seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, equivalent to two times (2x) the daily performance of the S&P Materials Select Sector Index.

The underlying market-cap weighted index tracks basic materials companies from the S&P 500, covering areas like metals, chemicals, and paper products.

For each commodity, the index selects the contract with the greatest backwardation in an attempt to mitigate roll costs. The 14 contracts are equally weighted, with monthly reconstitution and rebalancing. The fund is organized as an open-ended ETF, so does not issue a K-1 at tax time.

JIB,Janus Henderson Sustainable & Impact Core Bond ETF,"This actively managed bond fund primarily invested in investment-grade, USD-denominated bonds of any maturity, including both corporate and government issues, with a focus on US securities. Its core strategy aimed to deliver risk-adjusted returns exceeding its benchmark while concurrently generating positive social and environmental impact. Employing a proprietary multi-factor sustainability framework, the fund utilized negative screening to avoid issuers non-compliant with principles like the UN Global Compact or involved in negative impacts, alongside positive selection favoring bonds aligned with beneficial environmental and social themes through bottom-up fundamental and top-down thematic analysis. While centered on investment-grade debt, it maintained flexibility for small allocations to high-yield bonds (up to 5%) and foreign securities (up to 20%, including emerging markets). Decisions to sell holdings were driven by both declining investment appeal and failure to meet the fund's ESG and sustainability standards.","The fund invests at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in bonds.

PKW,Invesco BuyBack Achievers ETF,"This exchange-traded fund invests primarily in U.S. companies that have executed significant share repurchase programs, specifically targeting firms buying back at least 5% of their outstanding shares over the previous 12 months. It tracks a market-cap-weighted index derived from a proprietary selection methodology, typically investing at least 90% of its assets in these identified securities. The core concept rests on the premise that substantial buybacks may signal management's belief that the company's stock is undervalued. Consequently, the fund offers exposure predominantly to large-cap stocks fitting this buyback criteria, with its underlying index reconstituted annually and rebalanced quarterly.","The fund generally will invest at least 90% of its total assets in the securities that comprise the underlying index.

PKW holds stocks in firms that have purchased significant chunks of their own stock. The idea is simple: A firm's own managers know the best valuation of its stock, and if it's undervalued, they'll buy it up, assuming they have the cash. There are criticisms of this approach: perhaps the firm has nothing better to do with its earnings because it's a cash cow with no growth opportunities. Buybacks also buoy earnings-per-share without adding enterprise value. But for investors who want access to the buyback trend, PKW provides easy access, though it's worth noting that its thesis still yields a fund that looks like the broader market in some ways.

Its portfolio consisted primarily of securities from companies incorporated in Egypt or deriving at least 50% of their revenues or assets from the country, covering roughly 90% of the investable universe with approximately 25 of the largest and most liquid firms. While offering access to a potentially volatile and hard-to-reach market, the fund was non-diversified, and regulatory diversification requirements could cause its sector and size exposures to differ from an unconstrained benchmark, sometimes favouring smaller firms; individual holdings were capped at 8%. The index underwent quarterly rebalances, with potential for ad-hoc adjustments.

The security was delisted. The last day of trading on an exchange is March 21, 2024. EGPT offers reasonable exposure to this hard to reach space. It is a passively-managed fund that covers 90% of the investable universe consisting of the largest and most liquid companies that are incorporated in Egypt or have at least 50% of their revenues or related assets in Egypt. The index contains roughly 25 names, individually capped at 8% weighting in the index. Political turmoil shut down the Cairo exchange in spring of 2011, forcing VanEck to halt creations briefly. Investors should monitor the volatile condition in Egypt closely. Most of the distortions in exposure result from 1940 Act diversification requirements, which explain why the fund's sector breakdown differs materially from our unconstrained benchmark. The diversification rules also push the fund toward smaller firms relative to our benchmark. Apart from scheduled quarterly rebalances, the Index provider may carry out additional ad hoc rebalances to the Egypt Index.",,

CONY,YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF,"This actively managed fund primarily seeks to generate current income, with a secondary objective of providing exposure to the share price movements of a specific underlying technology stock involved in the digital asset ecosystem, subject to a cap on potential gains. It employs a synthetic covered call strategy, utilizing both standardized exchange-traded and FLEX options, and collateralizes its positions primarily with cash and US Treasurys. The strategy aims to replicate the underlying stock's price movements while generating income, typically monthly, by writing short-term call options, which limits participation in the stock's potential appreciation but fully exposes investors to downside risk. Importantly, the fund does not invest directly in the underlying company's shares, meaning investors are not entitled to dividends.

CONY aims to generate monthly income while providing exposure to the price returns of Coinbase Global Inc. stock (COIN), subject to a cap on potential gains. The fund utilizes a synthetic covered call strategy via standardized exchange-traded and FLEX options, which consists of three elements: i) synthetic long exposure, ii) covered call writing, and iii) US Treasurys for collateral. The synthetic long exposure seeks to replicate the price movements of COIN by purchasing and selling at-the-money calls and puts that have one- to six-month terms. To generate income, the fund writes call options with an expiration of one month or less and a strike price of approximately 0%-15% above COIN's current share price. This limits participation in potential gains if COIN shares increase in value. The short put positions fully expose investors to the downside of the stock. Note: the fund does not invest directly in COIN stocks.

GTIP,Goldman Sachs Access Inflation Protected USD Bond ETF,"This ETF seeks to provide investment results corresponding to a specific index composed of U.S. dollar-denominated, fixed-rate Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). Its core strategy involves tracking an index that uniquely excludes the most recently issued ('on-the-run') TIPS, focusing instead on the remaining ('off-the-run') issues, typically those with at least one year left to maturity. This approach aims to capitalize on potential value derived from liquidity effects, as these less liquid off-the-run securities may trade at a discount compared to their on-the-run counterparts. While excluding certain securities, the fund manages its portfolio to maintain an overall duration similar to that of the broader TIPS market and invests at least 80% of its assets in the securities constituting its underlying index.","The fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its assets (exclusive of collateral held from securities lending) in securities included in its underlying index.

FV,First Trust Dorsey Wright Focus 5 ETF,"This exchange-traded fund employs a concentrated, tactical strategy, investing at least 90% of its assets in just five other First Trust ETFs. These five are selected from a broader universe encompassing First Trust's US sector and global thematic ETFs, chosen based on the Dorsey Wright relative strength model to identify those exhibiting the strongest price momentum and meeting liquidity criteria. The selected ETFs are then held in equal weights within the portfolio. To manage turnover, while relative strength is monitored regularly, constituents are typically only replaced if their momentum falls significantly relative to peers. The underlying ETFs often utilize multi-factor strategies instead of traditional market-cap weighting, potentially leading to a mid-cap focus and offering a distinct, momentum-driven alternative exposure to global equities.","The fund will normally invest at least 90% of its net assets (including investment borrowings) in the exchange-traded funds (""ETFs"") that comprise the index.

Through these swaps, the fund exchanges fixed payments received from its bond holdings for floating payments tied to inflation rates, thereby hedging against *expected* inflation rather than the actual rate itself.
